# Aircraft Control in an FAA-Inspired Format

This plugin allows the assignment of headings, speeds, altitudes, and squawk codes to an already airborne aircraft on any frequency other than 123.45 (make sure the aircraft is selected in Aurora!) or over PM.

Example commands:
```
DIE
PD TRNDO
FH 180
C 050
S 250
SQ 1234
```
